Creating a Character Table
ctbl.py

Given: An unrooted binary tree T in Newick format for at most 200 species taxa.

Return: A character table having the same splits as the edge splits of T. The columns of the character table should encode the taxa ordered lexicographically; the rows of the character table may be given in any order. Also, for any given character, the particular subset of taxa to which 1s are assigned is arbitrary.

Sample Dataset
(dog,((elephant,mouse),robot),cat);

Sample Output
00110
00111
